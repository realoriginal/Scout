# Purpose

Scout is intended to be a design around a small SBC, or performant SBC, depending on what I decide and hardware required, that will assist in Woodsball / Militrary Simulation (  MilSim ) paintball. A few friends and I wanted to compete in an event, so my intention is to build something we can use to track either other, report enemy player locations, take pictures, and jam radios of other players, as well as troll. 

As of late I've chosen the performent [Odroid M1](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-m1-with-8gbyte-ram/) with the [Odroid M1 Aluminum Case](https://kksb-cases.com/products/kksb-odroid-m1-chassi) from KKSB. The camera I'm going for is the [M1-MIPI-CAMERA-KIT](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/m1-mipi-csi-camera-kit/) also developed by HardKernel to take a picture of the area in front of the camera. 

Need:
* Buttons and long wires to press to trigger actions
* Auto-connect to the wireless of a network to send data from ( how we communicate between each other using a hotspot on cell phones )
* Decent GPS module
* Ability to either: Jam/Listen in On/Play Audo over Radio for spying on other players actions whom may be utilizing radio to communicate.
